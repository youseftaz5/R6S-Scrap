This repository, R6S-Scrap, is specifically designed to scrape Rainbow Six Siege (R6S) operator data from Liquipedia. The ultimate goal of this data collection is to power a clean and structured dashboard.
Key Functionality and Components

•
PhotosExtract.py: A Python script likely responsible for extracting operator photo data.

Weapons.py: A Python script probably handling weapon-related data.
•
bigraphy.py: Another Python script, which may deal with biographical information for operators.
•
main.py: This is expected to be the primary execution script that orchestrates the scraping process.
•
requirements.txt: This file lists all the necessary Python dependencies required to run the project.
•
r6s_container: A folder that might store scraped data or related assets.
•
.gitignore: Specifies files and directories that should be excluded from version control.
